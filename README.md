# TweetParser

  This program accepts a directory or a file as stdin. If the user pass a directory all the JSONs will be parsed. 
if the file is compressed like .bz2 the program decompress it. We extract from the JSON some attributes of the tweet like id,
username, timestamp, client used, and tweet text.
