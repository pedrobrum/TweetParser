# TweetParser

  This program accepts a directory or a file as stdin. If the user pass a directory all the JSONs in this directory will be 
parsed. if the JSON is compressed like .bz2 the program decompress it. We extract from the JSON some attributes of the tweet
like id, username, timestamp, client used, and tweet text.
